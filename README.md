# Microfrontends-with-React
Microfrontends extend the concept of microservices to the frontend of web applications. Essentially, they break down a web application into smaller, independent modules or components, each responsible for a specific feature or function. This approach allows different teams to develop, deploy, and maintain these modules independently.
